# PortScanner
This is a Python script that performs a basic port scanning operation: it prompts the user to input a target IP address, then scans all ports (from port 1 to 65534) on that target IP address, printing out any open ports found during the scan, while also handling exceptions such as keyboard interruptions and socket errors.
